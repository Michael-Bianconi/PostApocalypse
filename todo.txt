notes:

    raylib uses degrees, cmath uses radians
    "camera.rotation = -player.rotation" will make the camera's rotation lock
        on the player, but it's hard to drive with it.

todo:

    make the handling tighter
    make the zombies chase the player more naturally
    make the roads more natural
    make the bushes prettier
    house rotations
    collision detection and handling
